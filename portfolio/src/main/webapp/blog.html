      <p>During the first week of my internship, I went through onboarding and technical trainings 
        and got to meet the team! I also got the opportunity to explore Google and all the amazing
        ERGs and intern groups that were created to make our internship experience the best it can be. 
        Although getting an influx of emails and go/ links to check out was a bit overwhelminig, being able 
        to take out time to explore everything made the first week very fun!

      <p>Week 2 was the beginning of our STEP starter projects! During this week, I made this portfolio website that 
        you are currently viewing. I had previously used HTML and CSS at a hackthon but throughout this week 
        I was able to use a lot more tools and add fancier featuress than I had before. I also learned a few  
        better ways to use GitHub and about the workflow process for code reviews. In addition, week 2 of my internship 
        was Intern Excellence Week and I was able to attend many of the fun and helpful workshops that were prepared just for us!
        Overall, it was a great week and pushed me to become even more excited for what else is to come during this summer :)
