    <p class="blog-intro">Welcome to my STEP blog! I will be updating this blog throughout my internship with all the 
      fun and awesome events and learning experiences that I will hopefully have. Feel free to use the dropdowns 
      below to view my thoughts on each week of my STEP internship!</p>

      <div class="panel">
        <p>During the first week of my internship, I went through onboarding and technical trainings 
          and got to meet the team! I also got the opportunity to explore Google and all the amazing
          ERGs and intern groups that were created to make our internship experience the best it can be. 
          Although getting an influx of emails and go/ links was a bit overwhelming, being able 
          to take out time to explore everything made the first week very fun!
        </p>

      <button class="accordion">Week 2</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Week 2 was the beginning of our STEP starter projects! During this week, I made this portfolio website that 
          you are currently viewing. I had previously used HTML and CSS at a hackthon but throughout this week 
          I was able to use a lot more tools and add fancier features that I had not used before. I also learned a few  
          better ways to use GitHub and about the workflow process for code reviews. In addition, week 2 of my internship 
          was Intern Excellence Week and I was able to attend many of the fun and helpful workshops that were prepared just for us!
          Overall, it was a great week and it pushed me to become even more excited for what else is to come during this summer :)
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">Week 3</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>During Week 3, I added the fun facts section of the About You page onto this portfolio. I learned about Datastore and 
          how to persist user inputted data to use at a later time. I learned how to use Java Servlets and a bit about Google's Guava. 
          Throughout this week, I also met with other interns through an intern game night where we ended our work day by playing Codenames! 
          I also bonded with my podmates by learning more about each other and playing Skribbl.io as well as met up with another pod to talk about 
          how the STEP internship is going so far. Lastly, I ended the week by meeting my mentor for this summer! Although it was a shorter week due 
          to the 4th of July holiday, I grew a lot and met some really great Googlers!

      <button class="accordion">Week 4</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Week 4's starter project included adding a couple libraries onto our portfolio page! I started the week by adding an authentication feature 
          that requires users to be logged in to add comments onto the About You page. This way, I know that each user's display name is unique 
          and I do not have to worry about the same person using a different display name each time they comment. After adding the authentication feature, 
          I moved on to adding an interactive chart feature to the About You page as well. This chart takes the user's input on their favorite genre of music 
          and updates the chart to include the user's input. Once the user selects a genre of music, they also see 5 songs that I really enjoy from 
          the selected genre. I was also able to attend a DEI training, meeting some new interns through Speed Friending, and attend a couple of helpful fireside chats. 
          I even got to meet some former interns on the GSuite Assistant team, which made this week fun and allowed me to feel even more integrated with the team!
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">Week 5</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>During Week 5, I worked on the last starter project, which was learning about Test Driven Development (TDD). Although we were not working on our portfolio project, 
          I was able to learn a lot about how JUnit testing works and the best practices for testing code. I was actually able to start the TDD project a bit earlier during week 4, 
          so I managed to finish the project by Tueday morning. Due to the early finish, my podmates and I were able to get started on our capstone project for the summer! We worked 
          together to brainstorm an idea for the project and finished the first draft of our design document. In addition, week 5 was the Google Women Intern Community's (gWIC) empowerment week! 
          There were many fun and helpful panels and events that went on throughout the week and I was able to meet many other interns and FTEs in the gWIC and Women@Google groups. 
          The GSuite Assistant team also had a board game night where the interns were able to meet even more Googlers on our team and play some awesome games while getting to know each other!

      <button class="accordion">Week 6</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Week 6 was the official beginning of our capstone project, ClubHub! My podmates and I built the first prototype of ClubHub, which included hard-coded data. I specifically worked 
          on the Profile page with all the student's personal information including name, year, and major. In addition, this page includes a list of all the clubs the student has joined and all 
          the announcements from each club the student is in. I also started using the UserService API to load the profile content based on which user is logged in. On the more social side, I attended 
          a #IAmRemarkable event, lunch chats, and the first STEP Cohort social :)
        </p>

    <div class="accordion-both">
      <button class="accordion">Week 7</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>For the capstone project, this week was mainly dedicated to integrating our prototype with the App Engine Datastore API so we could use user-inputted data rather than hardcoded data. 
          My podmates and I updated our design document with the MVP and Project Alpha features as well. We also held a design review with the G Suite Assistant team to get feedback on our 
          design document and ensure that we included valid features that we would be able to implement in the limited time we had. I also spent some time learning about Mockito so I could 
          properly test the code I wrote and specifically test the logic of the servlets. We also were able to attend a UX Office Hours session to receive feedback on the user experience of our site.  
          Furthermore, I had the midpoint conversation with both of my hosts and received feedback on ways I can improve during the rest of my internship! Lastly, I met with an SRE Googler to learn 
          more about the SRE role and attended an interview workshop, the gWIC "She is Unstoppable" Panel, and Intern Speed Friending. 
        </p>

      <button class="accordion">Week 8</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The biggest accomplishment of Week 8 was completing the MVP of ClubHub! I specifically worked on allowing the profile content to be editable and to let users leave clubs directly through 
          the profile page. Students can also join clubs on the Explore page and the Club's About Us page. I also worked on integrating the Blobstore API to allow students to upload profile pictures. 
          Lastly, I spent some time working on the styling for the overall web application including adding colors and making buttons more interactive. I also met another PM Googler who taught me about the 
          Product Management role and also attended the Fireside Chat with Cassandra Johnson, a team panel, and a speaker session.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">Week 9</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Week 9 centered on getting feedback from users and starting on the Project Alpha component of our capstone project. Specifically, I worked on fixing bugs / errors we had from the MVP and started to 
          work on understanding how to use the Google Calendar API to upload calendars onto ClubHub. I also integrated the Gmail API into ClubHub to send email notifications to users for club announcements. 
          While looking at the Google Calendar and Gmail APIs, we realized that we needed to switch our authentication process to use OAuth 2.0 so I spent some time switching all of our servlets to use this flow instead. 
          Finally I met a SWE on the YouTube watch team to discuss the YT Recommendation algorithms since I have had an interest in learning about the ML use in YouTube. I also was able to attend the Google Expats panel and 
          a magic show with the G Suite Assistant team.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">Week 10</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>This week I continued working on the alpha features for ClubHub. This included making email templates using HTML for the email notifications. I also worked on allowing students to express interest in a club 
          without having to officially join a club. This is helpful since students can decide at a later time if they want to commit to a club or not without receiving all of the notifications for the club. 
          I also spent time on incorporating the feedback we received from the greater team to ensure we have better user experience for ClubHub. My podmates and I also worked on our end of internship presentation and 
          submitted the presentation towards the end of the week. In terms of socials, I met a UX Designer to get all my UX-related questions answered!
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">Week 11</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>During the end of last week and this week, I was able to have three mock interviews with different engineers and received really great feedback from all of them on how I can improve in the future. I also worked 
          on the Alpha feature to allow officers of a club to add events to their club's calendar using the Google Calendar Events API. I also manually tested ClubHub and found a few bugs, which I fixed soon after. In addition, 
          I edited our method of integrating the Gmail API to the more proper way of using Gmail, which includes using the OAuth 2.0 flow. In order for this to correctly work, I needed to create an additonal servlet to redirect 
          the user to the permissions page when they log in so ClubHub has the ability to access the user's Google Calendar and Gmail. Lastly, my podmates and I received feedback for our presentation from our mentors and created 
          a separate presentation for the G Suite Assistant team. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">Week 12</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>For my last week, I primarily worked on fixing last minute bugs and preparing for the presentations later in the week. These bugs included allowing all users to view a club's calendar rather than just the founder and 
          adding a simple message to the Explore page when there are no registered clubs. I also completed my final evaluations and received feedback from my hosts on my overall internship performance. To end the internship, my 
          podmates and I presented our capstone project to our Cohort and the greater G Suite Assistant team! Overall, this internship has been an amazing experience and I am very proud of everything I was able to accomplish and 
          learn in these past couple months. I am so grateful for my hosts, podmates, the G Suite Assistant team, and the intern team for such a wonderful internship experience!
