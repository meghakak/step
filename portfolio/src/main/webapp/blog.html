    <p class="blog-intro">Welcome to my STEP blog! I will be updating this blog throughout my internship with all the 
      fun and awesome events and learning experiences that I will hopefully have. Feel free to use the dropdowns 
      below to view my thoughts on each week of my STEP internship!</p>

        <p>During the first week of my internship, I went through onboarding and technical trainings 
          and got to meet the team! I also got the opportunity to explore Google and all the amazing
          ERGs and intern groups that were created to make our internship experience the best it can be. 
          Although getting an influx of emails and go/ links was a bit overwhelming, being able 
          to take out time to explore everything made the first week very fun!

      <button class="accordion">Week 2</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Week 2 was the beginning of our STEP starter projects! During this week, I made this portfolio website that 
          you are currently viewing. I had previously used HTML and CSS at a hackthon but throughout this week 
          I was able to use a lot more tools and add fancier features that I had not used before. I also learned a few  
          better ways to use GitHub and about the workflow process for code reviews. In addition, week 2 of my internship 
          was Intern Excellence Week and I was able to attend many of the fun and helpful workshops that were prepared just for us!
          Overall, it was a great week and it pushed me to become even more excited for what else is to come during this summer :)

      <button class="accordion">Week 3</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>During Week 3, I added the fun facts section of the About You page onto this portfolio. I learned about Datastore and 
          how to persist user inputted data to use at a later time. I learned how to use Java Servlets and a bit about Google's Guava. 
          Throughout this week, I also met with other interns through an intern game night where we ended our work day by playing Codenames! 
          I also bonded with my podmates by learning more about each other and playing Skribbl.io as well as met up with another pod to talk about 
          how the STEP internship is going so far. Lastly, I ended the week by meeting my mentor for this summer! Although it was a shorter week due 
          to the 4th of July holiday, I grew a lot and met some really great Googlers!

      <button class="accordion">Week 4</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Week 4's starter project included adding a couple libraries onto our portfolio page! I started the week by adding an authentication feature 
          that requires users to be logged in to add comments onto the About You page. This way, I know that each user's display name is unique 
          and I do not have to worry about the same person using a different display name each time they comment. After adding the authentication feature, 
          I moved on to adding an interactive chart feature to the About You page as well. This chart takes the user's input on their favorite genre of music 
          and updates the chart to include the user's input. Once the user selects a genre of music, they also see 5 songs that I really enjoy from 
          the selected genre. I was also able to attend a DEI training, meeting some new interns through Speed Friending, and attend a couple of helpful fireside chats. 
          I even got to meet some former interns on the GSuite Assistant team, which made this week fun and allowed me to feel even more integrated with the team!

      <button class="accordion">Week 5</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>During Week 5, I worked on the last starter project, which was learning about Test Driven Development (TDD). Although we were not working on our portfolio project, 
          I was able to learn a lot about how JUnit testing works and the best practices for testing code. I was actually able to start the TDD project a bit earlier during week 4, 
          so I managed to finish the project by Tueday morning. Due to the early finish, my podmates and I were able to get started on our capstone project for the summer! We worked 
          together to brainstorm an idea for the project and finished the first draft of our design document. In addition, week 5 was the Google Women Intern Community's (gWIC) empowerment week! 
          There were many fun and helpful panels and events that went on throughout the week and I was able to meet many other interns and FTEs in the gWIC and Women@Google groups. 
          The GSuite Assistant team also had a board game night where the interns were able to meet even more Googlers on our team and play some awesome games while getting to know each other!
