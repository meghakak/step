    <p class="blog-intro">Welcome to my STEP blog! I will be updating this blog throughout my internship with all the 
      fun and awesome events and learning experiences that I will hopefully have. Feel free to use the dropdowns 
      below to view my thoughts on each week of my STEP internship!</p>

        <p>During the first week of my internship, I went through onboarding and technical trainings 
          and got to meet the team! I also got the opportunity to explore Google and all the amazing
          ERGs and intern groups that were created to make our internship experience the best it can be. 
          Although getting an influx of emails and go/ links was a bit overwhelminig, being able 
          to take out time to explore everything made the first week very fun!

      <div class="panel">
        <p>Week 2 was the beginning of our STEP starter projects! During this week, I made this portfolio website that 
          you are currently viewing. I had previously used HTML and CSS at a hackthon but throughout this week 
          I was able to use a lot more tools and add fancier features that I had not used before. I also learned a few  
          better ways to use GitHub and about the workflow process for code reviews. In addition, week 2 of my internship 
          was Intern Excellence Week and I was able to attend many of the fun and helpful workshops that were prepared just for us!
          Overall, it was a great week and it pushed me to become even more excited for what else is to come during this summer :)
