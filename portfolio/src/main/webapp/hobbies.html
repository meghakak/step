        <td class=wics-note>One of my hobbies is being involved on my school campus! Specifically, 
          the organization that I am most involved in is Women in Information and 
          Computer Sciences, or WICS. I have been a committee member ever since Winter quarter
          of my freshman year and I have served on the Marketing and Executive committees. 
          Last quarter, I was elected as next year's Internal Vice President, which comes with the
          duties of building and growing the WICS community and ensuring every member feels accepted.
          I do this through leading socials, retreats, and a year-long mentorship program. 
          WICS has allowed me to make many of my favorite college memories and I am excited to 
          go through the many more memories to come!</td>
