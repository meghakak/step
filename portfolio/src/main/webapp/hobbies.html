        <td class="hobby-note">One of my hobbies is being involved on my school campus! Specifically, 
          the organization that I am most involved in is Women in Information and 
          Computer Sciences, or WICS. I have been a committee member ever since Winter quarter
          of my freshman year and I have served on the Marketing and Executive committees. 
          Last quarter, I was elected as next year's Internal Vice President, which comes with the
          duties of building and growing the WICS community and ensuring every member feels accepted.
          I do this through leading socials, retreats, and a year-long mentorship program. 
          WICS has allowed me to make many of my favorite college memories and I am excited to 
          go through the many more memories to come!

        <td class="hobby-note">Another hobby of mine is Mixed Martial Arts. I started
          practicing this sport when I was around 13 years old and worked hard to 
          achieve my Black Belt in 2017, when I was 17 years old. After receiving my 
          Black Belt, I decided to stick around to teach other MMA students who 
          were working their way towards their Black Belt as well. Throughout my Black Belt 
          journey, I learned the four pillars surrounding our organization: 
          Honor, Loyalty, Family, and Bravery. These values have stuck with me during my
          first two years in college and hopefully will continue to drive me throughout the 
          rest of my life.</td>

        <td class="hobby-note">The one thing that can calm me down at any time is music! 
          I learned and played the trumpet throughout ages 9 to 18 and have been trying to find 
          some free time to play while I'm home for the summer. On the right, you can see a picture 
          of the trumpet section in my high school marching band. In addition, I also learned piano 
          during those same years and made it through grade 7 out of 8 in the ABRSM piano examination 
          board. Although I do not play my instruments as much as I used to, I make various Spotify 
          music playlists for all my friends by examining the genres of music they listen to and 
          providing them with fresh, new music that I believe they would enjoy.</td>
