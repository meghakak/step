      <h2>WICS</h2>
      <p class=wics-note>One of my hobbies is to be involved on my school campus! Specifically, 
        the organization that I am most involved in is Women in Information and 
        Computer Sciences, or WICS. I have been a committee member ever since Winter quarter
        of my freshman year and I have served on the Marketing and Executive committees. 
        Last quarter, I was elected as next year's Internal Vice President, which comes with the
        duties of building and growing the WICS community and ensuring every member feels accepted.
        I do this through leading socials, retreats, and a year-long mentorship program. 
        WICS has allowed me to make many of my favorite college memories and I am excited to 
        go through the many more memories to come!</p>
