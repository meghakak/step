      <h1>Megha's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Thank you for checking out my portfolio! My name is Megha and I'm a rising junior at UC Irvine majoring in 
        Computer Science and Engineering. I like to be involved on campus, to make my family and friends laugh, 
        and to put together music playlists for my friends! 
        I hope by going through this website, you can get to know a little more about me :)</p>
